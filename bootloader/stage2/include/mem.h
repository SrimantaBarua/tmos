// The BIOS gives us a memory map stored in a not-very-efficient manner. Plus it could have
// overlaps, be unsorted, and is probably not continuous. This module sorts and cleans the BIOS
// memory map, then translates it to a more efficient internal format
//
// The structure of a BIOS memory map region is described in stage1/boot_mbr.asm . This uses
// 24 bytes per region. Plus, it's not continuous. There was a discussion on the OS-Dev Wiki forums
// which I can't find now, which uses a 64-bit value to store a memory region. It stores the
// page-aligned start address of the region. And since physical addresses are of a max of 56 bits,
// this means that we have 20 bits to store various flags.
//
// This also means that there is not 'end' indicator for a region. The end of the region is just
// the start address of the next region. This ensures that the memory map is continuous. The end of
// the region with the highest start address is 0x00ff_ffff_ffff_ffff.
//
// The regions are stored in decreasing order of start address. This way, the region with a start
// address of 0 denotes the end of the map, so that we don't need any additional metadata to store
// the length of the map.
